/**
 * This implementation of the {@apilink Ability|ability} to {@apilink BrowseTheWeb}

 *
 * ## Using Playwright to `BrowseTheWeb`
 *
 * ```ts
 * import { actorCalled } from '@serenity-js/core'
 * import { BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright } from '@serenity-js/playwright'
 * import { By, Navigate, PageElement, Text } from '@serenity-js/web'
 * import { Ensure, equals } from '@serenity-js/assertions'
 * import { Browser, chromium } from 'playwright'
 *
 * const HomePage = {
 *   title: () =>
 *     PageElement.located(By.css('h1')).describedAs('title')
 * }
 *
 * const browser = await chromium.launch({ headless: true });
 *
 * await actorCalled('Wendy')
 *   .whoCan(BrowseTheWebWithPlaywright.using(browser))
 *   .attemptsTo(
 *     Navigate.to(`https://serenity-js.org`),
